# README for API Installation: 5. Set up Database

[Back to Install Table of Contents](README_API_INSTALL.md)

[BACK: 4. Set up Environment](README_API_INSTALL_SETUP_ENVIRONMENT.md)

## Before Installing Database

Please make sure you have installed PostgreSQL:

1a. [Installing PostgreSQL on Mac](README_API_INSTALL_POSTGRES_MAC.md)

1b. [Installing PostgreSQL on Linux](README_API_INSTALL_POSTGRES_LINUX.md)

## Setup - Database Creation

Make sure you have a database that matches the local database settings from the "config/environment_variables.json" file,
(Search for "DATABASES"). Using the database tool you prefer create the following Database. (You probably already created
the database in a previous step.)

    WeVoteServerDB
    
Also make sure you are running in your virtual environment, signified by the "(WeVoteServer)".

Populate your database with the latest database tables using these terminal commands (You probably already did this in 
a previous step, but it doesn't hurt anything to do this twice):

    (WeVoteServer) $ pip install psycopg2 
    (WeVoteServer) $ python manage.py makemigrations
    (WeVoteServer) $ python manage.py migrate

When prompted for a super user, enter your email address and a simple password. This admin account is only used in development.

If you are not prompted to create a superuser, run the following command:

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
## Test that WeVoteServer is running

Start up the WeVoteServer on Mac (You probably already installed requirements.txt in an earlier step, but it doesn't
hurt to do it again.):

    (WeVoteServer) $ cd /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonProjects/WeVoteServer/
    (WeVoteServer) $ source /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/PythonEnvironments/WeVoteServer3.4/bin/activate
    (WeVoteServer) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    (WeVoteServer) $ python manage.py runserver

Start up the WeVoteServer on Linux:

    (WeVoteServer) $ cd ~/PythonProjects/WeVoteServer/
    (WeVoteServer) $ source ~/PythonEnvironments/WeVoteServer3.4/bin/activate
    (WeVoteServer) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    (WeVoteServer) $ python manage.py runserver

## Grant yourself Admin rights

Find admin tools here:

    http://localhost:8000/admin

Now you will need to authenticate as an admin. You can log in with Email or Twitter account or Facebook account.

Login with Email:
If you created superuser with this command "python manage.py createsuperuser" during Setup - Database Creation step,
login with same email id and password, otherwise create superuser with the following command and use that email to
login:

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    
Note: If you ever need to update the password for this account, you can use this command, with your email address: `python manage.py changepassword dalemcgrew@yahoo.com`

or

Login with Twitter:
Please contact Dale.McGrew@WeVoteUSA.org for configuration settings you can add to your local
WeVoteServer/config/environment_variables.json file.

    Click "Sign in with Twitter" and use your Twitter credentials to Sign-In.

or

Login with Facebook:
Please contact Dale.McGrew@WeVoteUSA.org for configuration settings you can add to your local
WeVoteServer/config/environment_variables.json file.

    Click "Sign in with Facebook" and use your Facebook credentials to Sign-In.
    
After you have signed in, you will see an error message in red that states "You must sign in with account that has
Verified Volunteer rights to see that page." Just below the error message, there will be a field "we_vote_id" with a 
text string like "wv01voter1234" next to it, note the we_vote_id number.

### Give yourself Admin rights via PGAdmin

Open pgAdmin 4 and navigate to:

    Server Groups > Servers > WeVoteServer 

If you do not see "WeVoteServer", then do the following:

1) Right-click on "Servers" and choose "Create > Server"

2) Name: WeVoteServer

3) Switch to "Connection" tab

3a) Host name: localhost

3b) Port: 5432

3c) Maintenance database: postgres

3d) User name: postgres

Double click on WeVoteServerDB (there may be a red x thru it). It will prompt you for a password; leave it blank and click
OK. You may see an additional warning screen about saving passwords, if so, click ok. 

Once you are connected, navigate to:

    WeVoteServerDB > Schemas > public > Tables > voter_voter

Then, right click, and in the menu that appears, select:

    View Data > View Top 100 rows

In the new window that opens, scroll down and find the we_vote_id number, noted above. Scroll to the right to locate the box
"is_admin" click on it once, and a box will appear, click it and change it to TRUE. Then, go back to your browser, 
and click on:

    Back to Admin Home
    
### Give yourself Admin rights via command line

Run this command from your Postgres command line. Replace WE_VOTE_ID_HERE with the actual we_vote_id found above:

    UPDATE voter_voter SET is_admin=true WHERE we_vote_id='WE_VOTE_ID_HERE';
    
Once you see "admin: True" on your account page, sign out, and sign in again. This will lock in place your admin rights.

## Test your access

Now, you should be able to access the admin tools here:

    http://localhost:8000/admin
